# RAG-Chatbot-with-LLM-Expertise

## Introduction

Welcome to RAG-Chatbot-with-LLM-Expertise, an avant-garde open-source project that crafts a sophisticated chatbot empowered by cutting-edge Retriever-Augmented Generator (RAG) technology and the rich capabilities of large language models (LLMs). This endeavor employs [LangChain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain) and [LlamaIndex](https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index), along with a vector database like [Milvus](https://milvus.io/), to harness a comprehensive repository of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and language model research. Our goal is to deliver an AI expert system capable of engaging in informed dialogues and generating programming solutions within the AI domain.

## Core Features

- **Knowledge-Infused Dialogue**: Engage with a chatbot that can access a vast repository of AI research to deliver informed responses.
- **Programmatic Creativity**: Generate code snippets for AI tasks with the assistance of our LLM-backed chatbot.
- **Extensive Knowledge Base**: Aggregate a wealth of AI-related literature and code into a searchable knowledge repository.

## Technical Stack

- [LangChain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain): A framework for building applications with LLMs.
- [LlamaIndex](https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index): An indexing system to efficiently retrieve information.
- [Hugging Face LLMs](https://huggingface.co/models): Access to state-of-the-art pre-trained language models.
- [Milvus](https://milvus.io/): An open-source vector database designed for AI applications.
- AI Agent Integration: Incorporating AI agents that can autonomously interact with various data sources and services, enhancing the chatbot's ability to provide dynamic responses and generate solutions based on real-time data.

## Data Sources

Our chatbot's knowledge base is sourced from:
- Peer-reviewed academic papers.
- Open-source repositories on platforms such as GitHub.
- Curated search results via APIs for the most relevant and up-to-date information.

## Installation

(Installation guidelines will be provided here once the project is ready for its initial release.)

## Usage

(Instructions on how to interact with the chatbot and utilize its features will be added upon project completion.)
